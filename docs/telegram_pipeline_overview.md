# Telegram Message Intelligence Pipeline

## Overview

This document describes a system for fetching Telegram messages from channels, storing them efficiently, filtering by topic, and enabling AI-powered interaction such as summarization and question-answering. The end goal is to turn channel discussions into a usable knowledge base.

---

## General Idea

1. **Fetch messages** from Telegram channels using Pyrogram.
2. **Store messages** in a lightweight structured database (SQLite + JSON1).
3. **Preprocess** messages: clean formatting, extract metadata, and detect topics.
4. **Chunk** messages into manageable text blocks for AI consumption.
5. **Embed** text chunks using OpenAI or SentenceTransformers.
6. **Store embeddings** in a vector database.
7. **Enable AI chat** via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or file upload.
8. **Ask questions** or generate summaries based on what was discussed.

## Technologies Involved

| Step | Tool / Technology |
|------|-------------------|
| Telegram Integration | [Pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) |
| Message Storage | SQLite + JSON1 |
| Message Preprocessing | Python, regex, topic classifiers |
| Embedding | OpenAI Embeddings / `sentence-transformers` |
| Vector Storage | Chroma / Qdrant / Weaviate |
| RAG Framework | LangChain / LlamaIndex |
| AI Model | ChatGPT / Claude / Local LLM |
| UI/Interface | CLI, Streamlit, or file upload to ChatGPT |

## Steps

### 1. Fetch Messages

- Use `TelegramFetcher` to pull messages.
- Support interactive commands (`fetch_new`, `fetch_old`, `fetch_gap`, `list_chan`).
- Messages saved in SQLite with JSON1 to allow structured filtering.

### 2. Preprocess & Filter

- Clean up message text.
- Extract topics using rule-based or LLM-assisted topic modeling.
- Group related messages.

### 3. Chunk Messages

- Divide long discussions into meaningful text chunks (based on topic, date, or threads).
- Ensure chunks are LLM-friendly (within 4k–16k tokens).

### 4. Embedding & Indexing

- Convert chunks to vector representations.
- Store in vector database for fast retrieval.

### 5. AI Chat or Summary

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): fetch relevant chunks and feed into LLM.
- Alternatively, export topic-wise `.md` files and upload to ChatGPT or other PDF/MD readers.

## Usage Ideas

- Ask: “What did users complain about in March?”
- Summarize discussions by topic or time.
- Build internal knowledge bots.
- Use the Telegram channel as a lightweight project memory or CRM.

## Optional Extensions

- Dev Container or Docker setup for isolated execution.
- Daily automation using cron + CLI commands.
- Streamlit interface to browse messages and ask questions.
